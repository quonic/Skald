REM Build one of the Skald examples on Windows.
REM
REM Usage:
REM   build.bat                   builds 01_hello (default)
REM   build.bat 01_hello          builds examples\01_hello
REM   build.bat 01_hello run      builds and runs
REM
REM Prerequisites (one-time):
REM   1. Odin installed and on PATH.
REM   2. MSVC build tools installed; launch from the Developer command prompt.
REM   3. Vulkan loader on PATH (bundled with recent GPU drivers; otherwise
REM      install the Vulkan SDK from https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).
REM
REM The SDL3 runtime DLL is copied next to the built .exe automatically.

REM Locate Odin's install tree to find SDL3.dll. `where odin` returns the

REM it. We walk up one directory from odin.exe to reach the Odin root.
