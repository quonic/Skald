# Contributing

Skald is open source under the [zlib license](LICENSE). Contributions
are welcome — bug reports, doc fixes, small features, and particularly
the open work areas listed below.

## Reporting issues

File issues with:
- What you ran (example name, build command, platform)
- What you expected
- What happened instead (paste the full error, not a screenshot of
  text — text is greppable)
- For rendering bugs, a screenshot helps

## Small fixes

Send a PR. If the change is under ~30 lines, there's no need to
discuss first — we'll either take it or suggest a tweak. Larger
changes are easier to land if you open an issue first so we can
agree on direction before you invest real time.

## Open work areas

These are the concrete things Skald would benefit from that the
current maintainers either don't have bandwidth for or can't QA
alone. If you want to pick one up, file an issue tagging it so
we can coordinate.

### Complex-script shaping + bidi (high value)

Skald currently renders **Latin, Cyrillic, Greek, and CJK** correctly
(the last with a bundled or caller-supplied fallback font). Complex
scripts — **Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari and other Indic scripts,
Thai, Khmer, Myanmar, Tibetan** — render glyphs but without the
contextual reshaping those scripts require to be *linguistically*
correct.

Landing this takes three pieces:

1. **A shaper.** Accepts `(font, text_run, script_tag)` and returns
   positioned glyphs with correct contextual forms. For Arabic this
   means picking isolated / initial / medial / final letter forms;
   for Indic, cluster reordering; for Thai, tone-mark stacking. The
   pure-Odin `runa` backend already does Latin/Cyrillic/Greek
   shaping (GSUB / GPOS) — Arabic + Indic + Thai shapers slot into
   `skald/third_party/runa/shape/` as new modules. The default
   fontstash backend has no shaping path and won't get one; runa is
   set to become the default before 1.0 final.

2. **The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.** So mixed-direction runs
   ("the word الكلمة here") reorder visually per Unicode Annex #9.
   Lives alongside the shaper; needs to inform layout.

3. **RTL flow in layout widgets.** `row`, `form_row`, `text_input`
   caret/selection, and anything with `cross_align = .Start` need
   an "align to writing direction" mode. Touches
   `skald/layout.odin` broadly.

**Ideal contributor**: reads Arabic or Hindi natively, so they can
validate the output looks right to a reader of the language. A
non-native contributor can write the machinery, but real QA
absolutely needs a native speaker.

**Scope the work small**: starting with Arabic-only or Hebrew-only
is totally fine. The framework's Rule #1 is "land what you can
actually test." A pure-Odin Arabic shaper is meaningful in its own
right and doesn't require us to rewrite HarfBuzz in one go.

Tracking issue: #193.

### Native macOS menu bar (moderate)

Skald's `menu_bar` widget currently renders inside the app window
on all platforms. On macOS, this is non-native — Mac apps put their
menus in the top-of-screen system bar via AppKit.

Landing this means, on macOS only:

- Replace the in-window `menu_bar` render with NSMenu / NSMenuItem
  installations via `foreign` Objective-C runtime calls from Odin
- Route menu-item selections back into the app's Msg queue
- Hide the in-window bar on macOS (so it doesn't double up)

See `skald/platform_title_other.odin` for the existing
platform-conditional shim — this would be a fuller companion on
macOS.

Tracking issue: #188.

### macOS live-resize smooth reflow (moderate)

When the user drags a window corner on macOS, Cocoa's resize-
tracking loop blocks the main thread and Skald's event pump stops
firing. The compositor stretches the last rendered framebuffer
until release. Linux/Windows reflow smoothly during drag.

The fix is `SDL_AddEventWatch` + a re-entrant render path from the
callback. Requires careful thought about the per-frame arena and
`widget_store_frame_reset` to not blow up when re-entered.

Tracking issue: #191.

### macOS RSS reader (small)

`_bench_rss_kb` in `skald/app.odin` returns -1 on macOS. The
Linux branch reads `/proc/self/statm`. For macOS, use the Mach API
(`mach_task_basic_info`) to get `resident_size` and shift-right to
get KB.

Tracking issue: #192.

## Style

- Match the existing code's shape. Skald has a distinctive
  formatting style (tight, few blank lines, comments that explain
  *why* not *what*). New code should feel like it belongs.
- Docstrings on every new public proc. Comment style in existing
  files is a good reference.
- No emoji in committed code unless the user explicitly asks.
- Keep PRs focused — one change per PR. "Fixes #123 and also
  refactors layout" is harder to review than two separate PRs.

### Widget ids and sub-ids

When a new widget needs sub-ids (per-option, per-row, per-cell), use
one of the two established mixing patterns. **Don't roll your own with
XOR** — the framework's auto-id machinery already XORs internally and
two layers of XOR-with-multiply cancel each other if both layers use
the same multiplier. We hit this bug class twice during development
(once in a leaf-widget cleanup pass, then again when the auto-id
scope helper landed) and a real app surfaced it each time. The
framework's `widget_make_sub_id` is the single safe primitive.

Use either:

```odin
// Pattern A: framework helper, multiplication+addition mix.
// Right when the sub-key is a small int (option index, row position).
slot_id := widget_make_sub_id(base, u64(i + 1))

// Pattern B: hash a stable string key.
// Right when the sub-key has natural string identity (button name,
// dialog tag).
slot_id := hash_id(fmt.tprintf("widget-name-sub-%x", u64(base)))
```

Both partition into the explicit-bit half of the id space and have
~64-bit collision resistance. `widget_auto_id` already applies
Pattern A internally for positional widgets inside `widget_scope_push`,
so widgets that only use the auto-id mechanism don't need to do
anything extra. **Don't reach for raw `~`** — the helper exists so
nobody can forget which constants and operators to use.

### Conditionally-built children must be id-scoped

If your widget conditionally builds child widgets (e.g. option rows
when a popover is open), wrap that section in
`widget_scope_push(ctx, u64(id))` / `widget_scope_pop` so the
children's auto-id consumption doesn't shift the parent counter.

Without this, opening the popover spawns N extra `widget_auto_id`
calls into the parent counter. Every widget rendered after yours in
the tree — including a sibling dialog, another picker, a button —
gets a different id on open vs closed frames. Their `widget_get`
returns a fresh state on the open frame, and any state-driven
behavior keyed off that (notably the dialog's "closed→open transition
sweep") fires spuriously, wiping the popover that just got opened.

We hit this with `select` inside a dialog: clicking the trigger made
the popover flash open and close on the same frame because the
4 option-row buttons shifted the dialog's id, the dialog's widget_get
returned fresh state with `open=false`, and the sweep killed the
just-toggled select. `menu` and `context_menu` had the same risk.

```odin
// In a popover-bearing widget that builds N rows when open:
scope := widget_scope_push(ctx, u64(id))
rows := make([dynamic]View, 0, len(items), context.temp_allocator)
for item, i in items {
    append(&rows, button(ctx, item.label, item.msg, ...))  // calls auto_id
}
widget_scope_pop(ctx, scope)
```

Widgets that use *manual* hit-testing for their popover internals
(date_picker, time_picker, color_picker — clicks tested against
pre-computed rects, no nested `button(...)` calls) are already safe.
This rule only applies to widgets that nest other auto-id-consuming
widgets in the conditional branch.

### Parameter ordering convention

New widgets should follow the same parameter order so calling them
feels uniform. Keyword args insulate callers from positional changes,
but the *declared* order still matters for readability and for the
common positional-args case:

```
ctx, value, [payload,] on_change,    // required identity / dispatch
id,                                   // optional override (defaults to auto-id)
layout knobs,                         // width, height, padding
style knobs,                          // bg, fg, border, font_size, color_*
state knobs,                          // disabled, invalid
mode flags,                           // multiline, search, free_form, ...
advanced,                             // max_chars, error, format, ...
```

The `payload` slot only exists on the typed-payload variant; on the
standalone variant the position is occupied by the next required
arg (e.g. `label` for `checkbox`). Match the existing widgets
when in doubt — `text_input` and `select` are the canonical
references.

### Proc-group widgets

Every value-emitting widget is a proc group of two variants — the
standalone shape `widget(ctx, value, on_change, ...)` and the
typed-payload shape `widget(ctx, value, payload, on_change, ...)`.
The pattern, when adding a new widget:

```odin
my_widget :: proc{my_widget_simple, my_widget_payload}

@(private)
_my_widget_impl :: proc(ctx, value, ... shared params ...) -> (View, T, bool) {
    // Existing edit machinery. Returns (view, new_value, changed)
    // instead of calling on_change inline.
}

my_widget_simple :: proc(ctx, value, on_change, ... shared params ...) -> View {
    view, new_value, changed := _my_widget_impl(ctx, value, ...)
    if changed { send(ctx, on_change(new_value)) }
    return view
}

my_widget_payload :: proc(ctx, value, payload: $P, on_change: proc(p: P, v: T) -> Msg, ... shared params ...) -> View {
    view, new_value, changed := _my_widget_impl(ctx, value, ...)
    if changed { send(ctx, on_change(payload, new_value)) }
    return view
}
```

For widgets whose body constructs `Msg` values inline (e.g. `segmented`
hands a per-option Msg to `button(...)`), the wrapper pre-computes
a `[]Msg` slice and the impl takes that — see `_segmented_impl`. The
allocation cost is a few-element slice in the frame arena; trivial.

**Watch out for**: implicit-enum named args after a typed-payload
positional. `widget(ctx, value, payload, cb, direction = .Row)` may
fail enum inference because the proc-group resolution can't be sure
which overload until it sees `direction`. Qualify the enum
(`direction = Direction.Row`) and the call resolves cleanly.

## Running the examples + bench

```bash
./build.sh 00_gallery run    # build + run the full widget gallery
./bench.sh                    # frame-time + RSS across canonical examples
```

Before submitting a PR that touches the renderer or widgets, run
`./bench.sh` before and after — significant regressions on
`00_gallery` should be called out in the PR description.
