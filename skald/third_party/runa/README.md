# runa

A pure-Odin modern text engine — parsing, itemization, shaping,
line-breaking, rasterization. Built first to replace fontstash +
stb_truetype in [Skald](https://github.com/BuLEEto/Skald), designed
to be useful for any Odin project that needs production-quality text.

**Status:** v1.2.0 — bounded shape cache (LRU) on top of v1.1's
Latin autohinter and v1.0's complex-script punch list. UAX #9 bidi
at **100 %**, UAX #29 graphemes at 100 %, CFF2 variable instances,
COLRv1 emoji with the full 28 W3C composite blend modes + linear /
radial / sweep gradients, GPOS mark-to-ligature, frozen API
([`API.md`](API.md)), per-script shaping for **Devanagari, Bengali,
Gujarati, Kannada, Odia, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Gurmukhi, Thai,
Lao, Khmer, Myanmar** verified against HarfBuzz byte-for-byte, and
a Thai word-break dictionary so Thai paragraphs reflow at word
boundaries rather than as one giant unbreakable word. Full
scoreboard in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## What this is

The current Odin text-rendering story is `vendor:fontstash` plus
`stb_truetype` — a glyph atlas and basic kerning. That covers Latin
text at small scales but cannot:

- Shape complex scripts (Arabic joining, Devanagari conjuncts, Thai
  clusters, bidi).
- Break lines per Unicode UAX #14.
- Render colour emoji (COLRv0 / COLRv1 / CBDT / sbix tables).
- Apply OpenType features (ligatures, GPOS kerning, contextual
  alternates, stylistic sets).
- Subpixel-position glyphs.

`runa` is the long-term fix — a modern text engine in idiomatic
Odin with zero C dependencies at v1.0.

## v1.0 punch list status

All four items closed:

- **Thai word-break dictionary** — embedded PyThaiNLP corpus,
  longest-match trie, ~62 k entries. ✓
- **Complex Khmer multi-consonant clusters** — pre-base reorder
  fixed to move to syllable start, not just before base. ✓
- **Full Myanmar shaping** — joined the Indic pipeline; medial
  YA / medial RA / IPC=Top_And_Bottom_And_Left all reorder
  correctly. ✓
- **Two remaining bidi BidiCharacterTest mismatches** — ISR
  formation now tunnels through `all-BN` higher-level
  intervening runs. 100.00 % conformance. ✓

## Building

The library is a set of plain Odin packages — no build script needed.

```
odin check . -no-entry-point          # type-check the library
odin test  tests/parse                # parser tests
odin test  tests/raster               # rasterizer smoke tests
odin test  tests/runa                 # facade integration tests
```

The runnable demos:

```
# PGM-output, no GUI dependency — shapes Latin + emoji, writes a PPM
# image you can open in any viewer.
odin run examples/hello_world -- \
    tests/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf \
    tests/fonts/Twemoji-Mozilla.ttf \
    /tmp/hello.ppm

# Live raylib window — shows OpenType shaping, kerning, ligatures,
# and tinted text running through raylib's stock DrawTexturePro.
# ~50 lines of glue between runa and the renderer; demonstrates that
# runa is renderer-agnostic — works in any Odin project that can
# sample a texture and draw a quad (sokol_gfx, custom Vulkan / Metal,
# even a pure CPU pixel buffer).
odin run examples/raylib
```

Test fonts are not committed — fetch them into `tests/fonts/` per
[`tests/fonts/README.md`](tests/fonts/README.md), or let CI fetch
them. Tests that need a missing font skip with an INFO log so the
synthetic suite still runs on a fresh clone.

Odin's own standard library uses.

## Contributing

API is frozen ([`API.md`](API.md)) — bidi at 100 %, line break at
99.91 %, graphemes at 100 %, UAX #29 word boundaries at 100 %,
UAX #15 normalization (NFC / NFD / NFKC / NFKD) at 100 %, all 28
COLR composite blend modes, CFF2 variations, and the full
complex-script set (9 Brahmic — Devanagari, Bengali, Tamil,
Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Gurmukhi, Gujarati, Odia — plus 4
SEA — Thai, Lao, Myanmar, Khmer) all real. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build / test instructions
and the open-work pointer list (long-tail Khmer cluster polish,
performance hardening, COLRv1 sweep gradients).
