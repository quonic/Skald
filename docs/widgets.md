# Widget reference

Every public widget builder, grouped by what it's for. Signatures
here show the parameters you'll actually reach for — the full list is
in `odin doc ./skald`.

For usage patterns and finished apps, see the examples linked at the
end of each section.

## Callback shapes

Every value-emitting widget (text_input, checkbox, slider, select,
the pickers, etc.) accepts two callback shapes via an Odin proc
group. The compiler picks based on the call site:

```odin
// Standalone — pass on_change directly:
skald.text_input(ctx, s.email, on_email)

// Per-row — pass a payload and a callback that takes it:
skald.text_input(ctx, p.qty_str, p.id, on_qty_for_row)
```

Use the standalone shape when the field's identity is unique to the
view (a single email field, a settings row). Use the payload shape
when the same proc handles many rows / cells. The signatures below
show the standalone form for clarity; everywhere it appears, the
`payload, on_change(payload, value) -> Msg` variant is also available.

For "many widgets per row, share one identity" cases, see
`map_msg_for` — it threads the payload at the row boundary instead
of repeating it on every widget call. The cookbook's "Editable cells
per row" recipe walks through both styles.

## Layout

### Layout basics

Skald's layout is intrinsic-by-default: a `col` or `row` sizes itself
to fit its children unless you tell it otherwise. The four knobs every
container takes:

- **`spacing`** — gap between siblings (one number, applied between
  each adjacent pair).
- **`padding`** — gap inside the container's own edges (one number,
  applied on all four sides — there is no per-side variant).
- **`main_align`** — how leftover main-axis space is distributed:
  `.Start`, `.Center`, `.End`, `.Space_Between`. Only matters when
  there *is* leftover (i.e. the container is bigger than its children
  need).
- **`cross_align`** — perpendicular alignment of children: `.Start`,
  `.Center`, `.End`, `.Stretch`. **Default is `.Start`**, so a `col`
  containing one button leaves the button at its intrinsic width
  flushed to the left rather than spanning the column. Pass
  `cross_align = .Stretch` when you want children to fill the
  perpendicular axis (sidebars of full-width buttons, form rows of
  full-width inputs, etc.).

To fill the *main* axis, wrap a child in `flex(weight, child)`. A
`flex(1, button(...))` inside a `row` takes a share of the leftover
horizontal space, growing the button. `flex` only works when its
parent has a defined size on the main axis — see
[`gotchas.md`](gotchas.md) for the "my flex collapsed to zero"
symptom and fix.

Several widgets (`scroll`, `grid`, `virtual_list`, `table`) use the
convention that **zero on an axis means "fill the slot my parent
gives me"**. Hand them a slot by wrapping in `flex(1, ...)` or a
column with `cross_align = .Stretch`.

### col / row

```odin
col(..children, spacing = 0, padding = 0, width = 0, height = 0,
    main_align = .Start, cross_align = .Start, bg = {}, radius = 0)
```

Stack children along an axis. `col` is vertical, `row` is horizontal.
`spacing` is the gap between children; `padding` is the margin inside
the container. Zero on `width` / `height` means "size to fit content"
unless the parent is a flex layout, in which case you'll be stretched
to the assigned slot.

`main_align` controls how leftover main-axis space is distributed
(only relevant when there's no `flex` child eating it). `cross_align`
controls perpendicular alignment.

### wrap_row

```odin
wrap_row(..children: View, spacing = 0, line_spacing = 0,
         padding = 0, width = 0, bg = {}, radius = 0)
```

Like `row`, but flows children onto a new line when the next one
wouldn't fit horizontally. Per-line height tracks the tallest child
in that line. Use for chip / tag strips, toolbars whose item count
varies, anything where a fixed `row` would clip or overflow.

Inside a column with `cross_align = .Stretch` it wraps at the
column's width. Pass an explicit `width = X` for a fixed-width panel
that wraps tighter regardless of parent. **Example:
`examples/42_wrap_row`.**

### responsive

```odin
responsive(ctx, data: ^T, threshold: f32,
           narrow: proc(ctx, data: ^T) -> View,
           wide:   proc(ctx, data: ^T) -> View)
```

Picks `narrow` or `wide` based on the *slot's assigned width* — a 320
px sidebar embedded in a 1600 px window stays narrow. The two
builders share a typed `data` parameter so they stay closure-free;
the value gets snapshotted into the frame arena at view-build time.

Pair with `flex(1, responsive(...))` or a stretching column so the
slot has a meaningful width to measure against. For app-wide
"is the window narrow?" decisions read `ctx.breakpoint` (Compact /
Regular / Wide) instead — that's the cheaper inline check.

### grid

```odin
grid(ctx, columns: []f32, ..children: View,
     spacing_x = 0, spacing_y = 0, padding = 0,
     width = 0, bg = {}, radius = 0)
```

Two-dimensional table with aligned column widths. `columns` is a
per-column width array: a positive value fixes that column in pixels,
a zero makes it a flex column that splits the remaining width with
the other flex columns. Children fill row-major — the first
`len(columns)` children form the first row, the next `len(columns)`
the second, and so on.

```odin
skald.grid(ctx,
    {120, 0, 80},                  // label col fixed, middle flex, action col fixed
    row1_label, row1_content, row1_action,
    row2_label, row2_content, row2_action,
    spacing_x = 8,
    spacing_y = 4,
)
```

Pass a concrete `width` for a fixed-size grid; leave it at 0 to fill
the parent's cross axis (same contract as `scroll`, so the parent
must stretch the grid). The last row may have fewer children than
there are columns — extra cells render as empty spacers so the grid
stays rectangular.

### spacer

```odin
spacer(size: f32) -> View
```

A fixed-size gap. Use when you want a specific pixel distance between
two children instead of uniform `spacing`.

### flex

```odin
flex(weight: f32, child: View, min_main = 0) -> View
```

Inside a `row` or `col`, takes a `weight`-proportional share of the
leftover main-axis space. `flex(1, a)` alongside `flex(2, b)` splits
1/3 : 2/3. Inside a content-sized parent there is no leftover space,
so flex children collapse to zero — see `gotchas.md`.

`min_main` clamps the assigned share from below: a `flex(1,
text_input(...), min_main = 240)` won't be squeezed below 240 px
even when a tight parent would force it. Children pinned at their
floor exit the proportional pool; the rest re-split the remainder.

### sized

```odin
sized(ctx, data: ^T, build: proc(ctx, data: ^T, size: [2]f32) -> View,
      min_w = 0, min_h = 0)
```

Defers the `build` call until layout has assigned this node a rect,
then re-enters with the real size. Used internally by `scroll`,
`virtual_list`, `table` to implement "zero on an axis = fill the
assigned slot." Apps rarely call `sized` directly.

`min_w` / `min_h` are minimum width / height in pixels — if the
parent's assigned slot is smaller than these on either axis, the
deferred `build` is skipped and a zero-size spacer is rendered
instead. Stops fill-mode widgets from re-deferring infinitely when
they get squeezed to nothing.

### clip

```odin
clip(size: [2]f32, child: View) -> View
```

Hard-clip drawing to a fixed rect. Anything the child would draw
outside gets scissored away.

### scroll

```odin
scroll(ctx, size: [2]f32, content: View, wheel_step = 40,
       focusable = false)
```

Clipped viewport with an autohiding scrollbar. Zero on an axis means
"fill what my flex parent gives me"; pass real numbers to fix the
viewport size. `wheel_step` is the pixel distance one wheel notch
scrolls. `focusable = true` lets the viewport take keyboard focus
for PageUp/PageDown/arrow-key scrolling.

### split

```odin
split(ctx, first: View, second: View, first_size: f32,
      on_resize: proc(new_first_size: f32) -> Msg,
      direction = .Row, min_first = 40, min_second = 40)
```

Two-pane resizable container. `first_size` is the current size of
the first pane along `direction` (logical pixels). The divider is
draggable; drags fire `on_resize` with the new `first_size`.

**Example: `examples/21_split`.**

---

## Primitives

### text

```odin
text(str: string, color: Color, size: f32 = 14, font = 0, max_width: f32 = 0)
```

Draws a text run. `size` defaults to 14 px. Pass `max_width` to enable
word-wrap at that pixel width. `font` is the handle from `add_font`;
`0` means the renderer's default (Inter).

Embedded line breaks in `str` (`\n`, `\r\n`, or `\r`) produce hard
breaks — the widget renders as multiple stacked lines and `view_size`
reports the combined height. This means user-supplied multi-line
strings (chat messages, log lines, pasted Windows content) render
correctly without any caller-side splitting.

Tab characters expand to four spaces of visible width — no
column-aligned tab stops, just a fixed advance — so pasted code
blocks and log lines don't render `\t` as a missing-glyph tofu.

**Shape cache.** Skald's text engine (runa, default backend) memoises
shaping by `(font, size, text)` for fast re-renders. The cache is
bounded — soft default of 4096 entries (≈ 4-8 MB at body sizes) with
O(1) LRU eviction past the cap. Apps with high text churn (code
editors, log viewers, animated counters, financial tickers) hit the
cap and recycle oldest entries, keeping memory flat. Call
`skald.text_shape_cache_size(r)` to monitor the current count.

### text_selectable

```odin
text_selectable(ctx, str: string, color: Color,
                size: f32 = 14, font: Font = 0,
                max_width: f32 = 0, id: Widget_ID = 0)
```

`text`'s input-aware sibling: same render shape, plus mouse selection
and clipboard support. Use it when the rendered text needs to be
copyable — chat / message bubbles, code blocks, log lines, status
messages, error details. For inert chrome and labels, prefer plain
`text`; it's lighter (no `Widget_ID`, no per-frame state machinery,
no focus participation).

| Gesture / shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| Click + drag | Selects a byte range; the highlight follows the wrap |
| Double-click | Selects the word under the cursor (UAX #29 boundaries via runa) |
| Triple-click | Selects everything in the widget |
| `Ctrl-A` / `Cmd-A` | Select all (focus required) |
| `Ctrl-C` / `Cmd-C` | Copies the selected substring to the system clipboard |
| Click outside the widget | Focus leaves, selection clears |

Selection survives across frames while the widget retains focus; a
click into a different focusable widget transfers focus and the old
selection clears automatically — no Esc / cancel needed.

### rich_text



```odin
rich_text(ctx, spans: []Text_Span, base: Color,
          size: f32 = 14, font: Font = 0,
          max_width: f32 = 0, id: Widget_ID = 0)

rich_text_links(ctx, spans, base,
                on_link_click: proc(link: string) -> Msg,
                size, font, max_width, id)
```

One paragraph of mixed-style text. Each `Text_Span` carries its own
colour, weight (`Regular` / `Bold`), italic flag, optional inline
background fill, optional underline, and an optional `link` target.
Wrap (when `max_width > 0`) operates *across* span seams — bold,
italic, and inline-code runs flow into one another and word-break
only at spaces, never inside a run. Bundled Inter Bold / Italic /
Bold Italic faces are picked automatically per span.

Convenience constructors keep call sites readable:

```odin
spans := []skald.Text_Span{
    skald.span("Markdown rendering needs "),
    skald.span_bold("bold"),
    skald.span(", "),
    skald.span_italic("italic"),
    skald.span(", "),
    skald.Text_Span{
        str = "inline code",
        bg  = theme.color.surface,
    },
    skald.span(", and links like "),
    skald.span_link("the docs", "https://example.com"),
    skald.span("."),
}
skald.rich_text(ctx, spans, theme.color.fg, max_width = 480)
```

**Inline code chips.** Any span with `bg.a > 0` gets a rounded
background painted behind its glyphs (3 px horizontal inset, 1 px
vertical pad, 3 px corner radius). The chip resets per visual line
so a wrapped chip on two lines paints two rects, not one stretched
across.

**Links.** Switch from `rich_text` to `rich_text_links` and pass
`on_link_click: proc(link: string) -> Msg`. Spans with non-empty
`link` swap the cursor to a hand-pointer on hover and fire the
callback on left-click release. The `link` string is whatever the
app wants — URL, mailto, internal route id, message id — Skald
just plumbs it back. `rich_text_links` is a separate proc (not
`rich_text` with a nilable callback) because Odin's polymorphic
nil-default limit forbids a `proc() -> $Msg = nil` default — same
reason `search_field` is split out from `text_input`.

**Picking the right text widget:**

| Want | Use |
|---|---|
| Single styled run | `text` |
| Same, copyable by the user | `text_selectable` |
| Mixed weight / colour / size, no inline chips, no links | `rich_text` |
| Same plus clickable link spans | `rich_text_links` |
| Mixed-style text the user can select + copy | `rich_text_selectable` |
| Same plus clickable link spans (chat-bubble use case) | `rich_text_selectable_links` |
| Editable text | `text_input` |

**Example:** `examples/44_rich_text` — bold / italic mixing, mixed
sizes + colours, multi-line wrapped paragraph, inline-code chip,
and two clickable links with cursor swap.

### rich_text_selectable

```odin
rich_text_selectable(ctx, spans: []Text_Span, base: Color,
                     size: f32 = 14, font: Font = 0,
                     max_width: f32 = 0, id: Widget_ID = 0)
```

`rich_text`'s input-aware sibling. Same span composition and wrap
behaviour, plus the full selection model from `text_selectable`:
click-drag selects a range, double-click selects a word, triple-click
selects all, `Ctrl-A` / `Ctrl-C` work, click-outside clears.

Selection ranges are absolute byte offsets into the concatenation of
`spans[*].str` taken in document order. `Ctrl-C` strips span boundaries
and copies plain text — pasting elsewhere gives the user the same
characters they saw on screen, with no markup leaking out.

Use it when the bubble / paragraph mixes formatting (bold, italic,
inline-code chips, colour) AND the user is expected to be able to grab
text out of it.

### rich_text_selectable_links

```odin
rich_text_selectable_links(ctx, spans: []Text_Span, base: Color,
                           on_link_click: proc(target: string) -> Msg,
                           size: f32 = 14, font: Font = 0,
                           max_width: f32 = 0, id: Widget_ID = 0)
```

The full chat-bubble widget: everything `rich_text_selectable` offers
**plus** clickable link spans. Behaviour matches what users expect
from selectable-text-with-links in browsers and native chat apps:

| Gesture on a link span | Result |
|---|---|
| Quick press + release (no drag) | Fires `on_link_click(span.link)` after the multi-click resolution window (≈ 350 ms) expires |
| Press + drag > 4 px (Manhattan) | Starts a drag-selection anchored at the press byte; no link fire |
| Double-click | Word selection at click position; cancels the pending link fire |
| Triple-click | Select-all; cancels the pending link fire |

The deferred fire is what stops `Ctrl-A`-style multi-click selection
gestures from accidentally firing the link as well. Single tap to
navigate stays responsive (the 350 ms delay is below the threshold
where most users perceive lag, and matches what `dblclick` resolution
windows do in browsers).

`on_link_click` is required (no `= nil` default) because of Odin's
polymorphic nil-default limitation — a `proc(...) -> Msg = nil`
parameter can't be monomorphised when callers omit it. Apps that
want certain link spans to be inert can return a no-op `Msg` variant
from `on_link_click` and ignore it in `update`.

**Example:** `examples/47_selectable_text` — covers `text_selectable`,
`rich_text_selectable`, and `rich_text_selectable_links` in one
running window. Useful as a copy-paste starting point for chat-style
message bubble layouts.

### rect

```odin
rect(size: [2]f32, color: Color, radius: f32 = 0)
```

Flat coloured rectangle with optional corner radius.

### divider

```odin
divider(ctx, vertical = false, color = {}, thickness = 1)
```

A 1-pixel rule. Inside a `row`, use `vertical = true`; inside a `col`,
leave it off. Color falls back to theme border.

### image

```odin
image(ctx, path: string, width = 0, height = 0,
      fit = .Cover, tint = {1, 1, 1, 1})
```

Loads an image from `path` and draws it scaled to fit. `fit` is
`.Cover` (fill, crop), `.Contain` (fit, letterbox), `.Fill` (stretch),
or `.None` (pixel-exact). Images are cached by path — cheap to use
the same one in many places.

`path` can be a file path **or** a synthetic name registered through
`image_load_pixels` (see below) — the widget treats both the same.

**Example: `examples/20_image`.**

#### image_load_pixels

```odin
image_load_pixels(r: ^Renderer, name: string, w, h: u32, rgba: []u8) -> bool
```

Registers an in-memory RGBA8 buffer with the image cache under a
synthetic name, so any later `image(ctx, name, …)` draws it the same
way as a file-loaded image. Use it when the pixels come from anywhere
other than disk — a rasterized DXF / SVG / PDF page, a video frame, an
in-memory PNG fetched over the network, a procedurally generated
thumbnail, a golden-image test fixture.

`rgba` must be exactly `w * h * 4` bytes (RGBA8 sRGB, straight alpha).
Bytes are copied into a staging buffer synchronously — the caller's
slice does not need to outlive the call.

Pick a name unlikely to collide with any file path you might also
load (`"app://thumb/42"`, `"dxfwg.viewport"`). Calling with an
existing name replaces the entry (after a `DeviceWaitIdle`) so a
producer that re-renders on demand can keep the same name.

Returns `true` on success, `false` on size mismatch or allocation
failure. Pair with `image_unload(r, name)` when you're done.

**Not** intended for per-frame updates — replacement allocates a fresh
texture every call. For per-frame refresh of the same name + size,
seed once with `image_load_pixels` and refresh in-place via
`image_update_pixels` (below).

#### image_update_pixels

```odin
image_update_pixels(r: ^Renderer, name: string, w, h: u32, rgba: []u8) -> bool
```

Refreshes an already-registered image in place — reuses the existing
`VkImage` / memory / view / descriptor set. One staged copy + a queue
wait for that one upload, no fresh allocations, no `DeviceWaitIdle`.
Cheap enough for 60 fps streaming sources: software rasterizers (CAD
pan / zoom), video frame queues, paint canvases.

Preconditions: `name` already registered (call `image_load_pixels`
once first), and `w` × `h` matches the existing entry's extent. Mips
are regenerated CPU-side and re-uploaded each call so shrunken samples
don't read stale levels.

Returns false on miss (name not registered, or size mismatch) — caller
re-seeds via `image_load_pixels` if the dimensions changed.

#### draw_image

```odin
draw_image(r: ^Renderer, name: string, rect: Rect,
           fit = .Cover, tint = {1, 1, 1, 1}) -> bool
```

Paints a registered image inside a `canvas` callback at `rect` (logical
pixels). Use this when you want to composite an image *behind* app-drawn
overlay primitives (lines, markers, text) in the same canvas node — the
ordinary `image()` widget can't be interleaved with `draw_*` calls
because it lives in the view tree, not the immediate-mode canvas
pass. Same `Image_Fit` semantics as the widget.

### canvas

```odin
canvas(ctx, user: ^T,
       draw:   proc(user: ^T, painter: Canvas_Painter),
       id     = 0,
       width  = 0, height = 0,
       min_w  = 0, min_h  = 0,
       cursor = .Default)
```

Framework escape hatch for arbitrary drawing. The widget claims a
rectangular slot in the layout; at render time, your `draw` callback
runs with a `Canvas_Painter` you can use to emit any of the public
`draw_*` primitives (`draw_rect`, `draw_text`, `draw_triangle_strip`,
`draw_image`, etc.). Skald opens a clip to the canvas bounds before
the callback, so draws outside the rect are scissored away.

`user` is an opaque pointer the builder passes through to the callback
— pass app state, a per-frame snapshot, or any context the painter
needs. Zero on `width` / `height` means "fill the parent's assigned
extent"; non-zero forces a fixed size. `min_w` / `min_h` give the
canvas an intrinsic floor so it doesn't collapse inside a
content-sized stack.

`cursor` sets the OS pointer shape while the mouse is over the
canvas. `.Default` (the zero value) leaves the cursor unchanged.
Paint apps pick per-tool (`.Crosshair` for brush, `.Move` for pan /
camera, `.Not_Allowed` for a disabled tool). The field is read every
frame from app state, so changing the active tool just changes the
cursor on the next render — no callback wiring. For pixel-precise
brush rings or magnifier glasses, draw those inside the `draw`
callback anchored to `painter.mouse_pos` (OS cursors don't carry
custom imagery).

The canvas tracks its `last_rect`, so apps that need to do hit-testing
against `ctx.input.mouse_pos` can grab it via `widget_get(ctx, id,
.Canvas).last_rect`. Press / drag / release flow through `ctx.input`
the same way as any other interactive widget.

**Example: `examples/37_canvas`.** Drag the mouse or a pen to draw
pressure-varying strokes; `cursor = .Crosshair` shows how the OS
pointer shape switches when you hover.

---

## Buttons and links

### button

```odin
button(ctx, label: string, on_click: Msg,
       bg = {}, fg = {}, radius = 0, padding = {0, 0},
       font_size = 0, width = 0, text_align = .Center)
```

Clickable rectangle. `on_click` is the Msg value (not a proc) that
Skald enqueues when the button is clicked. `bg` and `fg` fall back to
theme neutrals — pass `th.color.primary` / `th.color.on_primary` for
a call-to-action.

### link

```odin
link(ctx, label: string, on_click: Msg, color = {}, color_hover = {},
     font_size = 0, underline = true)
```

Text-only clickable, no background or padding. For inline references,
hyperlink-styled actions, etc.

---

## Text entry

### text_input

```odin
text_input(ctx, value: string, on_change: proc(new: string) -> Msg,
           placeholder = "", width = 0, height = 0,
           font_size = 0, font = 0,
           disabled = false, multiline = false, wrap = false,
           password = false,
           clear_button = false, escape_clears = false,
           invalid = false, error = "", max_chars = 0)
```

Editable text field. Single-line by default; set `multiline = true`
for a text area (and `wrap = true` if you want soft-wrap). Built-in:
selection, clipboard (Ctrl+C/X/V), Ctrl-A select all, undo/redo
(Ctrl+Z/Y), cursor navigation, IME.

`font` is a `Font` handle from `font_load` (`0` = the default Inter).
The font threads through measurement, caret positioning, wrap, and
hit-testing — useful for a code/prose editor that wants a custom
typeface (e.g. Iosevka) without swapping the renderer's global
default.

`password = true` masks input and suppresses copy/cut. `clear_button =
true` adds a `×` button at the right edge that clears the value when
the field holds text. `escape_clears = true` makes the first Escape
empty the field and the second blur — the GTK / macOS search-field
convention. `invalid = true` + `error = "..."` renders the red-
underline error affordance. `max_chars` caps the buffer in runes (0
means no limit).

For a search box with all of these affordances *plus* an Enter-submit
callback, use `search_field` — it sets `clear_button` and
`escape_clears` for you and wires Enter.

`on_change` is called with the new value on every edit — you clone
the string onto state if you want to keep it (see `gotchas.md`).

**Examples: `examples/08_text_input`, `examples/18_forms`.**

### search_field

```odin
search_field(ctx, value, on_change, on_submit: proc() -> Msg,
             placeholder = "", ...)
```

The dedicated search-input widget. Sets `clear_button = true`,
`escape_clears = true`, defaults the placeholder to a localized
"Search…", and **fires `on_submit` whenever the user presses Enter**
while the field has focus.

Use this whenever pressing Enter on a search box should kick off
something — a server query, activating the highlighted result in a
launcher, etc. If you only need keystroke-by-keystroke filtering of
an in-memory list with no Enter behaviour, use `text_input` with
`clear_button = true, escape_clears = true` directly — same
affordances, no `on_submit` requirement.

### chat_input

```odin
chat_input(ctx, value, on_change, on_submit: proc(value: string) -> Msg,
           placeholder = "Message…", max_lines = 8, ...)
```

Multi-line composer for chat / comment-box surfaces. Wraps
`text_input(multiline = true, wrap = true)` and re-wires Enter so
the app can distinguish "send" from "newline":

- **Enter** — fires `on_submit(value)`. Empty values are no-ops, so
  apps don't have to gate.
- **Shift+Enter** — inserts a newline.
- **Ctrl+Enter** — also fires `on_submit` (Slack/Discord muscle
  memory).

Auto-grows from one line up to `max_lines` based on newline count;
beyond `max_lines` the field scrolls internally. The composer does
**not** clear itself on submit — the app decides (handy for
optimistic message rendering: clear on the resulting send-Msg).

### number_input

```odin
number_input(ctx, value: f64, on_change: proc(new: f64) -> Msg,
             step = 1, min_value = min(f64), max_value = max(f64),
             decimals = 0, width = 140)
```

Typeable numeric field with `+` / `−` stepper buttons on the side.
`decimals` controls the display precision. Out-of-range values are
clamped on commit.

**Example: `examples/22_form_extras`.**

---

## Booleans and choice

### checkbox

```odin
checkbox(ctx, checked: bool, label: string,
         on_change: proc(new: bool) -> Msg, disabled = false)
```

Classic boolean toggle with a label to the right. Pass
`label = ""` for a bare checkbox (in a table cell, say).

### radio / radio_group

```odin
radio(ctx, selected: bool, label: string,
      on_select: proc() -> Msg)

radio_group(ctx, options: []string, selected: int,
            on_change: proc(index: int) -> Msg,
            direction = .Column, spacing = -1)
```

`radio` is one circle. `radio_group` is the common case — a list of
string options, the runtime handles the "only one at a time"
semantics and arrow-key navigation.

### toggle

```odin
toggle(ctx, on: bool, label: string,
       on_change: proc(new: bool) -> Msg, disabled = false)
```

iOS-style pill switch. Same semantics as `checkbox`; picks when
you want the setting to feel less form-like and more affordance-y.

### select

```odin
select(ctx, value: string, options: []string,
       on_change: proc(new: string) -> Msg,
       placeholder = "", disabled = false, width = 0)
```

Dropdown. `value` is the currently chosen string (matched exactly
against `options`). Opens a popover of clickable rows. Use when the
option list is short enough that scanning is faster than typing.
Default placeholder comes from `ctx.labels.select_placeholder`
("Select…" in English).

**Example: `examples/12_select`.**

### combobox

```odin
combobox(ctx, value: string, options: []string,
         on_change: proc(new: string) -> Msg,
         placeholder = "", filter = true, free_form = false,
         disabled = false, max_chars = 0, max_rows = 8, width = 0)
```

Text-input trigger with a filtered dropdown. Typing narrows the list
(by default); arrow keys move the highlight; Enter or click commits.
Use instead of `select` when the option list is long enough that
scanning becomes slower than typing.

`filter = false` keeps the full list visible while typing — useful
for short lists where you want Windows-style "type a letter, jump to
first match" typeahead.

`free_form = true` lets Enter commit whatever the user typed even
when it isn't an option. Email entry with suggestions, tag inputs,
and similar "suggestions are helpers, not a constraint" flows fit
this shape.

`max_rows` caps the visible dropdown height in rows. The dropdown
always shows the full filtered option set — when there are more
than `max_rows` options, the overflow is scrollable (mouse wheel,
scrollbar, keyboard auto-scroll keeps the highlight in view), not
silently dropped. Default 8 fits comfortably under most triggers;
bump it for known-large catalogues (model pickers, country lists)
or trim it for tight layouts.

The dropdown auto-grows wider than the trigger when a label
exceeds the trigger's width, so long entries (e.g. fully-qualified
identifiers, file paths) don't clip. It's clamped to the
framebuffer width so it can never paint off-screen.

Opening the dropdown highlights the currently-selected value and
scrolls the viewport to it — the user sees "where am I" the moment
the popover appears. First-time / unmatched values land at row 0.

Escape cancels (blurs without committing). Clicking outside the
trigger or popover also dismisses.

**Example: `examples/00_gallery` (Selection section); `examples/43_chat_input`'s timezone picker exercises the scrollable >max_rows path.**

### segmented

```odin
segmented(ctx, options: []string, selected: int,
          on_change: proc(index: int) -> Msg, disabled = false)
```

Mutually-exclusive tabs styled as a connected pill. Good for small
option sets where you want everything visible at once.

---

## Range and numeric

### slider

```odin
slider(ctx, value: f32, on_change: proc(new: f32) -> Msg,
       min_value = 0, max_value = 1, step = 0,
       width = 0, track_h = 4, thumb_r = 8, disabled = false)
```

Horizontal draggable value control. `step = 0` gives continuous
values; any positive step quantizes (e.g. `step = 0.1` snaps to
tenths). `track_h` is the height of the track in pixels;
`thumb_r` is the radius of the round thumb. Bump those if your
density needs a chunkier slider.

### progress

```odin
progress(ctx, value: f32, width = 0, height = 6,
         color_bg = {}, color_fill = {},
         indeterminate = false, period = 1.2)
```

Non-interactive fill indicator, `value ∈ [0, 1]`. Set
`indeterminate = true` for the "working…" sliding bar animation;
`period` is its cycle time in seconds.

### spinner

```odin
spinner(ctx, size = 24, color = {}, phase = 0)
```

Circular indeterminate "working, no known ETA" indicator — eight
dots in a ring, alpha trailing around the circle. Schedules its own
next frame via `widget_request_frame_at`, so lazy redraw keeps the
animation running without the app managing a ticker.

### rating

```odin
rating(ctx, value: int, on_change: proc(v: int) -> Msg,
       max_value = 5, size = 20,
       filled = "★", empty = "☆")
```

Clickable row of stars. Click a star to set that rating; click the
currently-set star to clear.

---

## Date, time, color

### date_picker

```odin
date_picker(ctx, value: Date, on_change: proc(new: Date) -> Msg,
            placeholder = "", disabled = false,
            min_date = {}, max_date = {},
            format: proc(d: Date) -> string = nil,
            week_start = .Locale)
```

Form-row trigger that opens a calendar popover. Leaves the app owning
the `Date` value. `format` overrides the display formatter; default
is locale-aware (`date_format`, which reads `LC_TIME`/`LANG` or
Windows regional settings). Default placeholder and month/weekday
names come from `ctx.labels` — see the **Labels and i18n** section
in `architecture.md`.

The popover has a footer with **Today** (jumps to the current date
+ commits + closes) and **Clear** (zeroes the value so the trigger
reverts to its placeholder). `Date{}` = year 0 / month 0 / day 0 is
the canonical "no date" sentinel.

**Example: `examples/30_date_picker`.**

### time_picker

```odin
time_picker(ctx, value: Time, on_change: proc(new: Time) -> Msg,
            placeholder = "",
            minute_step = 15, second_step = 0,
            format: proc(t: Time) -> string = nil)
```

Trigger that opens an hour/minute/second popover. Default shows
only hours + minutes (minute step 15); set `second_step > 0` to
surface seconds. See `time_format_12h` / `time_format_24h` for
explicit 12- or 24-hour display.

The popover has a **Now** button that commits the current wall-clock
hour + minute (snapped to `minute_step`, seconds zeroed) and closes.
There is no Clear button — `Time{}` is a valid midnight, so "clear"
has no unset state to snap to. Apps that need a nullable time should
wrap it in a `Maybe(Time)` or similar and own their own clear button.

**Example: `examples/31_time_picker`.**

### color_picker

```odin
color_picker(ctx, value: Color, on_change: proc(new: Color) -> Msg,
             width = 0, disabled = false)
```

Swatch trigger that opens an HSV square + hue strip + hex input
popover. Emits `on_change` live while dragging and on hex commit.

**Example: `examples/35_color_picker`.**

### emoji_picker

```odin
emoji_picker(ctx, on_pick: proc(emoji: string) -> Msg,
             recents = nil, disabled = false)
```

😀 trigger that opens a popover with a substring-match search bar,
optional recents row, 9 Unicode CLDR category tabs, a paginated 8 × 6
grid of ~1150 single-codepoint emojis, and a Fitzpatrick skin-tone
toolbar. Picking a person / hand emoji while a non-default tone is
selected appends the modifier codepoint to the returned string.

Coverage is the intersection of Twemoji-Mozilla (Skald's bundled
colour-emoji font) and Unicode emoji-test.txt. ZWJ sequences
(family compositions, mixed-tone people pairs) are out of scope
for v1.

`recents` is **app-owned**: pass a `[]string` slice of recently
picked emojis, most-recent-first; the picker renders a row above the
tabs whenever the slice is non-empty. Maintain it on `State` however
fits — a fixed-size ring, JSON-persisted across sessions, whatever.
Setting it to `nil` (the default) hides the row entirely.

The picked emoji string lives in the temp arena — clone it before
storing on persistent state, same convention as any Msg-borne string.

Backend: colour emoji renders properly only under runa, which is the
default backend since 1.0. If you've opted back into fontstash with
`-define:SKALD_RUNA=false` the cells still hit-test, but glyphs render
**completely blank** — Twemoji-Mozilla ships COLR colour layers only;
its `glyf` outlines are empty, so fontstash has nothing to draw. The
widget prints a one-time stderr warning the first time it runs under
fontstash so devs notice during testing.

**Example: `examples/46_emoji_picker`.**

---

## Lists and tables

### virtual_list

```odin
virtual_list(ctx, state: T, total_count: int, item_height: f32,
             viewport: [2]f32,
             row_builder: proc(ctx, state: T, index: int) -> View,
             row_key:     proc(state: T, index: int) -> u64,
             overscan = 4, variable_height = false,
             estimated_height = 0, focusable = false)
```

Renders only the rows currently visible in `viewport`. `state` is
passed through to `row_builder` untouched; the builder indexes into
it to produce the row view. Zero on an axis = fill (same as `scroll`).

**`row_key` is required** — it returns a stable `u64` identity for
the item at index `i`. Widget state inside cells (focus, text buffer,
checked, expanded) is scoped by this key, so state follows the
*item* through reorders / filters / sort changes rather than
following the row position.

**The returned value must be unique across the visible rows** — two
rows with the same key share one widget scope, which means clicks,
hover, and edit buffers collide between them. `-debug` builds print
a console warning the first time they detect a duplicate
(`[skald] virtual_list id=…: row_key returned duplicate value 0x… at
rows N and M`); release builds silently mis-behave, so don't ignore
the warning.

For synthetic lists that never reorder, the simplest correct key is
the row index itself: `proc(s: ^State, i: int) -> u64 { return u64(i) }`.
For a real data set, return the item's database id — or, if your data
has natural duplicates (the same item appearing in two categories,
say), composite the discriminator into the key
(`(u64(category_code) << 32) | u64(item_id)`).
A nil `row_key` safely falls back to index-keying.

Set `variable_height = true` with `estimated_height` as a seed when
rows differ in height; the list measures each row on first render and
caches. Most apps don't need this.

**Examples: `examples/16_virtual_list`, `examples/27_fill_list`,
`examples/29_fill_scroll`, `examples/24_chat`.**

### table

```odin
table(ctx, state: T, columns: []Table_Column, row_count: int,
      item_height: f32, viewport: [2]f32,
      row_builder: proc(ctx, state: T, row: int) -> []View,
      row_key:     proc(state: T, row: int) -> u64,
      on_row_click: proc(row: int, mods: Modifiers) -> Msg,
      is_selected: proc(state: T, row: int) -> bool,
      on_sort_change: proc(col: int, ascending: bool) -> Msg,
      on_resize: proc(col: int, new_width: f32) -> Msg,
      on_row_activate: proc(row: int) -> Msg,
      sort_column = -1, sort_ascending = true,
      focus_row = -1, header_height = 32,
      hairline = false)
```

Virtualized, sortable, resizable, selectable data grid. `row_builder`
returns one `View` per column (must match `len(columns)`). Any
callback may be nil to disable that interaction. `row_key` is
required and works the same way as in `virtual_list`: it returns the
stable id for the item at `row`, so state scoped inside cells
follows the item when the user re-sorts the table. A typical
sorted-table pattern is `proc(s: ^State, visible: int) -> u64 {
return u64(s.sorted[visible]) }` where `s.sorted[visible]` maps the
visible row position to the underlying source row.

**Hairlines**: `hairline = true` draws a 1-px divider along the
bottom of every row in `theme.color.border`. This is the modern
data-table look (Stripe, Linear, GitHub PR list) — separates rows
without fighting the backgrounds of cells that hold widgets with
their own fills. The divider sits inside the row's `item_height`
so the virtualized scroll math stays correct; the last row skips
the line so the table doesn't end with a floating edge.

**Column sizing**: each `Table_Column` sets *either* `width` (fixed px)
*or* `flex` (share of leftover width), not both. A column that has
neither set gets zero width and disappears — designate at least one
column as flex so it expands to fill the viewport.

**Cell views**: `row_builder` should return raw views (`text`, `badge`,
`button`, …) one per column — exactly `len(columns)` of them, in the
same order. Wrapping each cell in a `col(…)` with its own padding
breaks column alignment; the col sizes to its text and drifts out of
the column slot. The table owns cell padding and the column-wide
width; let it. Debug builds assert on cell-count mismatch so a
miscounted slice surfaces at the row builder instead of mysteriously
showing a badge in the Owner column.

For shift-select / ctrl-toggle, read `mods` in `on_row_click`.
`on_row_activate` fires on double-click or Enter when a row has
keyboard focus.

Widget IDs inside `row_builder` are auto-scoped per `row_key(state,
row)` return value (same as `virtual_list`) — cells can contain any
stateful widget without extra ceremony, and state follows the item
through every sort / filter.

Column visibility: set `Table_Column.hidden = true` to collapse a
column entirely (header, body cells, and resize handles are skipped).
`row_builder` is still called with the full set of cells — it's
simpler to over-produce and let the table drop the hidden ones than
to thread a visible-column mask through the builder. Good for
letting users show/hide columns via a settings menu without
re-shaping the app's row logic.

**Examples: `examples/17_table`, `examples/28_fill_table`.**

### tree

```odin
tree(ctx, rows: []Tree_Row,
     on_toggle: proc(row_idx: int) -> Msg,
     on_select: proc(row_idx: int) -> Msg,
     row_height = 0, indent = 0, width = 0)
```

Flat-array collapsible outline. You build `[]Tree_Row` in your own
code (depth, label, expanded, selected fields); the widget handles
rendering, keyboard nav, and click/toggle events. Keeping tree shape
on app state means you can reorder and filter without fighting the
widget.

**Example: `examples/34_tree`.**

---

## Navigation

### tabs

```odin
tabs(ctx, labels: []string, active: int,
     on_change: proc(index: int) -> Msg)
```

Horizontal strip of tab labels, one marked active. The tabs widget
doesn't swap content for you — render the appropriate body based on
`active` in your `view`.

### breadcrumb

```odin
breadcrumb(ctx, segments: []string,
           on_select: proc(index: int) -> Msg,
           separator = "›", font_size = 0)
```

Clickable nav trail. `on_select` fires with the index of the clicked
segment.

### menu_bar

```odin
menu_bar(ctx, entries: []Menu_Entry(Msg))
```

Top-level menu bar with keyboard accelerators and hover-switch between
menus. Each `Menu_Item` carries a label, an optional `Shortcut`, the
`Msg` to dispatch, and three optional flags:

- `disabled = true` — grey the row out, drop the shortcut from the
  global accelerator registry.
- `separator = true` — render a horizontal divider; all other fields
  ignored.
- `checked = true` — prefix the row with a ✓ glyph for togglable
  state (View → Show Grid, View → Word Wrap, etc.). Set this from
  your state in `view`; dispatch a flip-msg on click. The leading
  column is only reserved when at least one item in the active menu
  is currently checked, so menus without checks lay out unchanged.

Need an icon next to a label? Use the same Font Awesome / Lucide /
Phosphor fallback trick from the Fonts cookbook section — embed the
PUA codepoint in `label`.

**Example: `examples/33_menu_bar`.**

### command_palette

```odin
command_palette(ctx, open: bool,
                entries: []Menu_Entry(Msg),
                on_dismiss: proc() -> Msg,
                width = 520, max_rows = 10,
                placeholder = "Type a command…")
```

Ctrl+K-style fuzzy-search overlay that reads from the same
`[]Menu_Entry` slice `menu_bar` consumes. Enter dispatches the
highlighted item, Esc calls `on_dismiss`, ↑/↓ walk the match list.
Only `menu_bar` registers shortcut accelerators — the palette is a
passive viewer, so hotkeys never double-fire. Apps without a visible
menu bar can pass entries with empty labels and the palette drops
the "Entry → " prefix from rows.

**Example: `examples/00_gallery`** (Ctrl+K).

---

## Containers and layout helpers

### list_frame

```odin
list_frame(ctx, first: View, rest: ..View,
           bordered = true, divided = true,
           bg = {}, border = {}, div_color = {},
           padding = -1, radius = -1, width = 0)
```

A surface card with hairline border and 1-px dividers between rows —
the Mac/iOS "grouped list" look. `first` is required so Odin's
polymorphic variadic can infer `$Msg`; any later rows go in `rest`.

### form_row

```odin
form_row(ctx, label: string, control: View,
        label_width = 0, spacing = 0)
```

Pairs a left-hand label with a right-hand control. Build forms by
stacking `form_row` inside a `col`.

**Examples: `examples/18_forms`, `examples/22_form_extras`.**

### section_header

```odin
section_header(ctx, title: string, color = {}, font_size = 0)
```

Horizontal rule with a centered title, for grouping settings or form
sections without full card borders.

### collapsible

```odin
collapsible(ctx, title: string, open: bool,
            on_toggle: proc(new_open: bool) -> Msg,
            content: View)
```

Disclosure triangle + content panel. You own the open/closed bool;
the widget fires `on_toggle` when clicked.

**Example: `examples/25_collapsible`.**

### accordion

```odin
accordion(ctx, sections: []Accordion_Section, open_index: int,
          on_toggle: proc(idx: int) -> Msg,
          spacing = 0, padding = -1, font_size = 0)
```

Group of `collapsible`-like panels where at most one is open at a
time. The app owns `open_index`: `-1` means "all closed," any valid
index means "that one is open." Clicking the open panel's header
closes it; clicking a different one swaps.

`on_toggle` fires with the index that should become the new
`open_index` — the caller just stores what it's given:

```odin
Panel_Toggled :: distinct int
// …
case Panel_Toggled: out.panel_idx = int(v)
```

Use for settings drawers, property inspectors, and other "look at
one thing at a time" groups. For the "any number open at once"
pattern, stack independent `collapsible` widgets in a `col`.

### empty_state

```odin
empty_state(ctx, title: string, description = "",
            action: View = View_Spacer{size = 0})
```

Centered placeholder for empty lists and no-search-match results.
Pass an optional `action` view (typically a button) to guide the user.

---

## Small decorations

### badge

```odin
badge(ctx, label: string, tone = .Primary,
      bg = {}, fg = {}, font_size = 0)
```

Small rounded pill for counts ("3"), status tags ("NEW"), labels.
`tone` is one of `.Primary`, `.Neutral`, `.Success`, `.Warning`,
`.Danger`.

### chip

```odin
chip(ctx, label: string,
     on_close: proc(label: string) -> Msg,
     tone = .Neutral)
```

Badge with an × close glyph. Use for filter tags, selected items in
a picker, and other "things that can be dismissed."

### avatar

```odin
avatar(ctx, initials: string, size = 32, bg = {}, fg = {})
```

Circular user chip. Colour is hashed stably from the initials, so the
same person always gets the same colour. For a "+N more" roster,
compose `row(avatar(...), avatar(...), spacing = -10)` — the negative
spacing produces the overlapping-bubble look without a dedicated widget.

### kbd

```odin
kbd(ctx, label: string, font_size = 0)
```

Keyboard shortcut hint, styled as a slightly-raised rounded rect.
`kbd("⌘K")` or `kbd("Ctrl+S")`.

### stepper

```odin
stepper(ctx, labels: []string, current: int, disc_size = 24)
```

Horizontal progress indicator for multi-step flows (wizards,
checkouts). Visual only — advance by updating `current` from your
Msgs.

### alert

```odin
alert(ctx, title: string, description = "", tone = .Primary)
```

Inline notice box with a coloured left stripe. Use for warnings and
info banners that should stay visible in-flow, not pop up as toasts.

---

## Floating and feedback

### overlay

```odin
overlay(anchor: Rect, child: View,
        placement = .Below, offset = {0, 0})
```

Low-level popover primitive — pins `child` to `anchor` on the overlay
layer. Used by `select`, `menu`, `date_picker`, etc. Apps usually
want the higher-level widgets rather than calling `overlay` directly.

### tooltip

```odin
tooltip(ctx, child: View, text: string)
```

Hover-triggered popover after a short delay. Wraps any existing view.

### dialog

```odin
dialog(ctx, open: bool, content: View,
       on_dismiss: proc() -> Msg,
       initial_focus: Widget_ID = 0,
       width = 0, max_width = 480, padding = 0,
       bg = {}, border = {}, scrim = {})
```

Modal dialog with a full-frame scrim. The scrim swallows clicks but
**does not dismiss** — Esc and explicit buttons are the only ways
out. `on_dismiss` fires on Esc.

On open the dialog snapshots whatever widget held focus; on close it
restores that focus. `initial_focus` (when non-zero) seeds focus to
a specific widget inside the card on open — typically the first
text input.

**Example: `examples/19_dialog`.**

### confirm_dialog

```odin
confirm_dialog(ctx, open: bool, title, body: string,
               on_confirm, on_cancel: proc() -> Msg,
               confirm_label = "OK", cancel_label = "Cancel",
               danger = false, width = 0)
```

Sugar over `dialog` for the "are you sure?" prompt. Title + wrapped
body + two buttons. `danger = true` tints the confirm button red
for destructive flows.

### alert_dialog

```odin
alert_dialog(ctx, open: bool, title, body: string,
             on_ok: proc() -> Msg,
             ok_label = "OK", width = 0)
```

Single-button variant of `confirm_dialog` for error / success /
"you've been signed out" acknowledgements.

### toast

```odin
toast(ctx, visible: bool, message: string,
      on_close: proc() -> Msg, kind = .Info,
      anchor = .Bottom_Center, max_width = 420,
      margin = 16, dismiss_after = 0)
```

Viewport-pinned notification ("snackbar"). `kind` is `.Info`,
`.Success`, `.Warning`, or `.Danger`. Set `dismiss_after = 3.0` for
auto-dismiss after 3 seconds (the runtime schedules an internal
`cmd_delay`).

**Example: `examples/23_editor`** (save/load success and error toasts).

### menu

```odin
menu(ctx, labels: []string,
     on_select: proc(index: int) -> Msg,
     on_dismiss: proc() -> Msg, width = 200)
```

Vertical popover of clickable rows — context menus, dropdown lists.
For menu-bar style top-level menus, use `menu_bar` instead.

## Interaction helpers

### right_click_zone

```odin
right_click_zone(ctx, child: View, on_right_click: Msg)
```

Wraps a child view as a right-click target. Emits `on_right_click`
when the user right-clicks inside the rect. Use when you want the
click to go to app state and you'll drive the popover yourself;
otherwise prefer `context_menu` which bundles both.

### context_menu

```odin
context_menu(ctx, child: View, items: []string,
             on_select: proc(index: int) -> Msg, width = 200)
```

Right-click-detecting wrapper that pops a menu of `items` at the
click point. Selecting an item fires `on_select(i)`; clicking outside
or pressing Escape dismisses. Open state lives inside the widget —
callers only see the on_select msg when the user commits.

```odin
skald.context_menu(ctx,
    layer_row_view,
    {"Rename", "Duplicate", "Delete"},
    proc(i: int) -> Msg { return Layer_Menu(i) },
)
```

Auto-flips above the cursor when a below-cursor placement would
overflow the framebuffer, same rule as date/time/color pickers.

### drop_zone

```odin
drop_zone(ctx, child: View,
          on_drop: proc(files: []string) -> Msg)
```

Passthrough wrapper that fires `on_drop` when files are dragged from
the OS onto the child's rect. File paths are frame-arena strings —
clone what you want to keep.

### drag_over

```odin
drag_over(ctx, id: Widget_ID) -> bool
```

Returns true while a drag is in progress **and** the cursor is inside
the matching `drop_zone`'s rect. Use this to tint the drop zone's
border during drag-over.

**Example: `examples/23_editor`** (drop a file to open it).

## Framework helpers

These aren't widgets — they're small procs exposed for app-level
coordination that doesn't fit inside a single builder's signature.

### widget_tab_index

```odin
widget_tab_index(ctx, id: Widget_ID, tab_index: int)
```

Override the Tab ring position of a focusable widget for the current
frame. Positive values come first in ascending order; `0` (the
default every widget registers with) means "natural order after
everyone with an explicit index." Call after the widget builder;
a no-op if `id` didn't register (disabled widget, or
wrong id). HTML `tabindex` semantics minus the negative case.

### widget_make_sub_id

```odin
widget_make_sub_id(parent: Widget_ID, key: u64) -> Widget_ID
```

Derive a stable per-option / per-row / per-cell sub-id from a
parent widget id and a numeric key. Use this when a custom widget
has internal sub-widgets that need their own state slots — each
star of a `rating`, each header of an `accordion`. Don't reach
for raw `parent ~ key`; small ints XOR-alias when the parent is
itself a small int, which silently breaks state-tracking under
`widget_scope_push`. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full note.

### theme_system

```odin
theme_system() -> Theme
```

Picks `theme_dark()` or `theme_light()` from the OS preference,
then overlays the user's chosen accent colour where the platform
exposes one. Currently wired for GNOME (`gsettings
org.gnome.desktop.interface accent-color`); macOS and Windows
fall back to Skald's primary until the platform fetches land.

`theme_with_primary(base, accent)` is the building block — swap
the primary on a theme and recompute `selection` and `on_primary`
from it. Useful for "let the user pick their own accent" prefs.

### App.always_redraw

```odin
// On App:
always_redraw: bool
```

Opt out of lazy redraw — every frame renders, regardless of whether
state changed. Default is `false` (lazy, battery-friendly). Flip to
`true` for DAWs, live-video previews, custom-canvas animations
driven from app state — anything where you want a predictable
per-frame loop instead of waiting for events. See the cookbook
"Force a render every frame" recipe.

### font_add_fallback

```odin
font_add_fallback(r: ^Renderer, base, fallback: Font) -> bool
```

Chain `fallback` onto `base` so codepoints missing from the base
font fall through to the next font in the chain. Use
`font_default(r)` as `base` to extend the framework-wide glyph
coverage beyond Inter (Latin + Cyrillic). Up to 20 fallbacks per
base. Handles CJK / Cyrillic extensions / symbols cleanly. Under
runa (the default backend since 1.0) full OpenType shaping (ligatures,
GPOS kerning, contextual alternates, RTL + bidi, Indic shaping) is
applied. If you've opted into fontstash with `-define:SKALD_RUNA=false`
glyphs render without shaping.

### font_use_default_emoji

```odin
font_use_default_emoji(r: ^Renderer) -> Font
```

Returns the Font handle for Skald's bundled Twemoji-Mozilla
(COLRv0 layered TTF). **Twemoji is already registered as a fallback
to `font_default(r)` automatically during `text_init`**, so plain
`text("hi 😀")` already renders colour emoji with zero app-side
setup — most apps never need to call this helper. Idempotent: when
called, it returns the cached handle.

Reasons you might still call it: you want the explicit handle to
chain a further fallback, replace the emoji font, or query metrics.

Backend behaviour: under runa (the default since 1.0) the emoji
render as full COLRv0 colour glyphs via an RGBA atlas. If you've
opted into fontstash with `-define:SKALD_RUNA=false` they fall
through to `.notdef` tofu — fontstash doesn't decode COLR tables, so
the auto-registration is a silent no-op on that path.

Bundled artwork is Twemoji (CC-BY-4.0). Apps shipping a Skald
binary are redistributing it — add an attribution line in your
About / docs. Full notice at
[`skald/assets/Twemoji-Mozilla-CCBY.txt`](../skald/assets/Twemoji-Mozilla-CCBY.txt).

### Window_State, initial_window_state, on_window_state_change

```odin
Window_State :: struct {
    pos: [2]i32, size: Size, maximized: bool,
}
// On App:
initial_window_state:    Window_State
on_window_state_change:  proc(ws: Window_State) -> Msg
```

Round-trip window geometry through the app's own persistence so the
window remembers its size and position between launches. See the
cookbook recipe "Save and restore window size / position between
launches."

## Audio capture and playback

Microphone capture and PCM playback via SDL3 — no new C dependency.
Samples are 32-bit float (`f32`); SDL converts to/from the device's
native format. **Codec is the app's job** — Skald handles only raw
PCM, so Opus / AAC encoding lives in the app. The audio subsystem
inits lazily on first open, so apps that never use it pay nothing.

### Capture

```odin
audio_capture_devices(allocator = context.temp_allocator) -> []Audio_Device
audio_capture_open(device_id = 0, rate = 48000, channels = 1) -> (^Audio_Capture, bool)
audio_capture_available(cap) -> int            // queued samples
audio_capture_read(cap, into: []f32) -> int    // pull samples, returns count
audio_capture_close(cap)
```

`device_id = 0` opens the system default mic. Capture starts on open;
poll `audio_capture_read` from your update loop (or a `cmd_delay`
tick) to drain samples as they arrive — SDL buffers internally so a
slow poll won't drop audio. 48 kHz mono is the right default for voice.

### Playback

```odin
audio_playback_devices(allocator = context.temp_allocator) -> []Audio_Device
audio_play_open(device_id = 0, rate = 48000, channels = 1) -> (^Audio_Playback, bool)
audio_play_write(pb, samples: []f32) -> bool   // queue PCM
audio_play_queued(pb) -> int                   // samples still pending
audio_play_close(pb)
```

Write a whole decoded clip at once, then poll `audio_play_queued`
until it hits 0 to detect playback finish (or drive a progress bar).

### Device selection

`audio_capture_devices` / `audio_playback_devices` return
`[]Audio_Device{ id, name }`. Feed the names to a `select`, store the
chosen `id`, pass it to the matching `_open`. No dedicated audio
widget — the picker is a `select`, the controls are `button`s, the
level meter is a `rect` whose width tracks input RMS.

### Robustness + platform notes

- **Device removal is safe.** Unplugging mid-use doesn't crash —
  capture goes quiet (`audio_capture_read` returns 0), and a
  default-device stream auto-migrates to the new default.
- **macOS / iOS mic capture needs `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`** in
  the app bundle's Info.plist (a packaging concern; playback needs no
  permission).
- Cross-platform via SDL3: Linux (Pulse / PipeWire / ALSA), macOS
  (CoreAudio), Windows (WASAPI).

**Example: `examples/48_audio`** — pick a mic, record with a live
input-level meter, play it back. Raw PCM, no codec.
