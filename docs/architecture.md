# Skald Architecture

This document describes how Skald fits together: the frame loop, the view
tree, widget identity, theming, async I/O, and the rendering pipeline.
It's written for people reading the source or writing non-trivial apps —
if you just want a taste, start with `examples/07_counter`.

## The elm loop

A Skald app is four things — `State`, `Msg`, `update`, `view` — glued
together by `skald.run`.

```
skald.App(State, Msg) {
    init:   proc() -> State
    update: proc(State, Msg) -> (State, Command(Msg))
    view:   proc(State, ^Ctx(Msg)) -> View
}
```

`State` and `Msg` are compile-time type parameters, so `update` sees the
app's real message union — not a rawptr, not an interface. Widget builders
(`button`, `select`, `text_input`, …) are parameterized by `Ctx($Msg)`
the same way, which keeps `skald.button(ctx, "Save", Msg.Save)` type-safe
end to end.

### One frame

`skald.run` drives this loop (see `skald/app.odin`):

```
loop {
    window_pump(&w)              // SDL events → Input snapshot
    drain_due_delays(...)        // cmd_delay timers whose deadline passed
    nbio.tick(0); drain_io(...)  // completed async ops → Msg queue
    widget_advance_focus(...)    // Tab / Shift-Tab
    widget_store_frame_reset()
    modal_click_preprocess()     // scrim swallows backdrop clicks
    if frame_begin() {
        v := app.view(state, &ctx)   // build the tree, hit-test, push Msgs
        render_view(r, v, ...)       // draw the tree
        render_overlays(r)           // dropdowns/menus/tooltips on top
        frame_end(r)
    }
    window_set_text_input(...)   // IME on/off for focused field
    while msgs not empty {
        state, cmd = update(state, msg)
        process_command(cmd, ...) // Now msgs re-enter the loop; Delay/Async queue
    }
    free_all(temp_allocator)
}
```

Key properties:

- `view` and `update` never talk to the outside world directly. I/O goes
  through `Command(Msg)`; the runtime performs it.
- Strings built inside `view` (and Msg payloads built inside builders) live
  in `context.temp_allocator`, reset at the end of every frame. If a Msg
  payload must survive into `update` or beyond, clone it before returning
  from the builder or on first receipt.
- `cmd_now` msgs cascade within a single frame. `Delay`, `Batch`-of-delay,
  and `Async` commands land on later frames.
- One frame of lag between a *view-generated Msg* (a click) and its visible
  result: the click is pushed in frame N, consumed by `update` at the end
  of frame N, rendered from new state in frame N+1.

## The view tree

`View` is a recursive record built each frame (see `skald/view.odin`). The
top-level builders:

- Layout: `col`, `row`, `wrap_row`, `grid`, `flex`, `clip`, `scroll`,
  `split`, `responsive`
- Primitives: `text`, `rect`, `spacer`, `image`, `divider`
- Widgets: `button`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `toggle`, `slider`, `progress`,
  `select`, `text_input`, `number_input`, `segmented`, `tabs`, `menu`,
  `right_click_zone`, `drop_zone`, `tooltip`, `toast`, `dialog`, `link`,
  `table`, `virtual_list`

Widgets *push* Msgs onto `ctx.msgs` when the input frame says they were
clicked, dragged, typed into, or dropped on. The builder returns a `View`
describing what to draw; nothing executes synchronously inside the builder
other than hit-testing against the previous frame's rectangle.

Layout is a single top-down pass during `render_view`: containers measure
children, assign rects, and the draw pass emits commands in tree order.
That's why widgets hit-test against `last_rect` (the *previous* frame's
rect) — the current frame's rect isn't known yet at builder time.

## Widget identity

Widgets need to persist focus, hover, press, selection, scroll offsets, and
other bits across frames. The `Widget_Store` (`skald/widget.odin`) is a
map from `Widget_ID` to `Widget_State`.

Two IDs sources:

- **Positional** — `widget_auto_id` assigns the first widget id 1, the
  second id 2, and so on. Stable while the tree shape is stable.
- **Explicit** — `hash_id("my-key")` when the tree shape changes (list
  rows that can reorder or filter, dialogs opening and closing) and you
  need state continuity across the shuffle.

`virtual_list`, `virtual_list_variable`, and `table` push a per-row
scope around each `row_builder` call, so positional auto-IDs inside a
row are salted with the row index — widgets in a row keep their state
as the visible window slides, no `hash_id` boilerplate required. Reach
for explicit IDs when rows can reorder or be filtered underneath you
and you want state to follow the *item*, not the row position. See
`examples/15_advanced` for the reorder-with-explicit-ids pattern.

`Widget_Kind` is stored with the state so the runtime can zero out state
that belonged to a different widget in the same slot — a dropdown that
lost its slot to a button won't have its `open=true` leak into the button.

Two hit-test helpers, split by purpose. `rect_hovered(ctx, rect)` is the
*visual* check — hover tints, tooltips. `widget_hovered(ctx, id)` is the
*input* gate every interactive builder uses for clicks and presses: it reads
a per-widget overlay-layer stamp, so a main-tree widget is z-blocked when a
modal or popover sits in front of it — even if its rect falls inside the
dialog card or popover (geometry alone can't tell a popover's own child from
a background widget behind it). Use `widget_hovered` to gate clicks in a
custom widget; reserve `rect_hovered` for visual hover.

## Theming

`Theme` is plain data (`skald/theme.odin`) — four nested groups (`color`,
`radius`, `spacing`, `font`) passed through `ctx.theme`. Ship a new theme
by constructing a literal or copy-and-override from `theme_dark` /
`theme_light`.

Themes are passed down explicitly. There's no global "current theme" —
multiple apps in the same process can use different themes, and unit
tests can construct a `Ctx` with any theme without global state.

Colors are stored in **linear space**. Construct from sRGB hex via `rgb`
/ `rgba`; `color_lighten` / `color_darken` mix in linear space. For
hover / press tints that need to stay visible across theme swaps, use
`color_tint(c, t)` — it picks lighten-or-darken by luminance so white
and near-white surfaces still produce visible feedback (one-directional
lighten is a no-op on white).

## Labels and i18n

`Labels` is a sibling of `Theme` — a struct of framework-supplied
user-visible strings (picker placeholders, date/time helpers, the
Today/Now/Clear buttons in the picker footers). Threaded through
`ctx.labels` the same way `Theme` is threaded through `ctx.theme`.

```odin
labels := skald.labels_en()
labels.select_placeholder       = "Seleccionar…"
labels.date_picker_placeholder  = "Elegir fecha"
labels.month_names              = [12]string{"Enero", "Febrero", …}
skald.run(skald.App(State, Msg){
    theme  = skald.theme_dark(),
    labels = labels,
    …
})
```

Zero-value `App.labels` falls back to `labels_en()` at startup, so
existing apps behave identically to pre-i18n builds. Apps shipping
other locales call `labels_en()` as a seed and override fields.

`Labels` covers the strings Skald itself produces; everything else
(button labels, dialog titles, form headings) is app-supplied and
lives in the app's own translation flow. RTL layout mirroring, CJK /
Arabic / Devanagari font coverage, and pluralisation are all out of
scope for Skald — they're separate infrastructure items that apps
can layer if they need them.

## Async I/O and commands

`Command(Msg)` describes a side effect (`skald/command.odin` +
`command_io.odin`). The runtime performs it and feeds the result back as a
`Msg`. No threads are exposed to app code — completions arrive on the main
loop some number of frames after the command was returned.

Kinds:

- `cmd_now(msg)` — re-enter `update` with `msg` on the *same* frame.
- `cmd_delay(seconds, msg)` — deliver `msg` after a wall-clock delay.
- `cmd_batch(cmds...)` — bundle several commands.
- `cmd_read_file(path, on_result)` — async read via `core:nbio`.
- `cmd_write_file(path, bytes, on_result)` — async write via `core:nbio`.
- `cmd_open_file_dialog(filters, on_result)` — native Open picker (SDL3).
- `cmd_save_file_dialog(filters, on_result)` — native Save picker (SDL3).
- `cmd_thread(payload, work)` / `cmd_thread_simple(work)` — run a sync
  proc on a dedicated worker thread, deliver its return value as a
  Msg. The escape hatch for *any* blocking library (postgres, sqlite,
  sync HTTP, large-file parsers) that isn't nbio-shaped — most aren't.
  Worker contract: don't touch Skald state, return one Msg per call,
  surface errors as Msg variants. Strings in the in/out payload must
  be heap-allocated, not temp-arena.

All I/O is non-blocking. `nbio.tick(0)` runs at the top of each frame and
any completions land on the Msg queue via `drain_io`. Handler procs (the
`on_result` parameters) run on the main loop before `update`, not on a
worker thread — think of them as translators from the I/O completion
record into the app's `Msg` union. `cmd_thread` is the exception: its
worker proc runs on a fresh OS thread; its return value crosses back
through a per-app mpsc mailbox drained at the top of each frame.

Lifetime rules: result buffers (`File_Read_Result.bytes`, the dialog path
string) are handed to the handler on the persistent heap. The handler is
responsible for cloning into app-owned storage and freeing the original
buffer if it took ownership. See `examples/23_editor` for the pattern.

## Input and drag-and-drop

`Input` (`skald/input.odin`) is a per-frame snapshot: mouse position and
delta, button edges, scroll delta, UTF-8 text, held/pressed/released key
bit-sets, modifiers, and OS drag-and-drop state.

Coordinates are in **framebuffer pixels** — `window_pump` scales SDL's
window-logical coords up by the HiDPI ratio so hit tests match the draw
pass on any display.

Edge-triggered fields (`mouse_pressed`, `scroll`, `text`, `keys_pressed`,
`dropped_files`) are cleared at the start of each pump. State fields
(`mouse_buttons`, `keys_down`, `drag_active`) carry across frames.

Drag-and-drop surfaces via `drop_zone(child, on_drop)` and `drag_over(id)`
for hover feedback. `dropped_files` paths live in the frame arena; if the
handler needs them later it must clone onto the persistent heap.

## Rendering pipeline

One Vulkan rendering scope per frame (`CmdBeginRendering` / `CmdEndRendering`
using dynamic rendering — no render-pass objects). Rects, text, and images
share a single pipeline (`skald/pipeline.odin`, `shaders/ui.vert`+`ui.frag`
compiled to SPIR-V and `#load`-embedded) keyed off a per-quad `kind`
attribute. That keeps draw-call count low and sidesteps a sort — the view
tree already emits commands in the correct order.

Text runs through one of two backends, selected at build time via
the `SKALD_RUNA` define. The default (`runa`, vendored at
`skald/third_party/runa/`) is a pure-Odin text engine with OpenType
GSUB/GPOS shaping (ligatures, contextual alternates, mark
positioning), COLRv0 + COLRv1 colour emoji (with linear / radial /
sweep gradients), subpixel-x positioning, and a shape cache that
hits per-frame redraws. The fallback (`fontstash`, opted in with
`-define:SKALD_RUNA=false`) is the long-shipped path: glyphs atlased
to a GPU R8 texture on demand, basic kern-pair lookup, no shaping. Both share the public
`draw_text` / `measure_text` / `wrap_text` / `text_ascent` /
`font_load` / `font_add_fallback` API — `skald/text.odin` dispatches
at runtime via a `runa_state` field on the renderer. `measure_text`
is exposed to widget builders so text-input's caret-from-click
hit-testing doesn't wait for the draw pass.

Images are uploaded lazily on first reference and cached by path.
