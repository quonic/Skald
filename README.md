# Skald

**An Elm-architecture GUI framework for Odin with immediate-mode-level
performance.** Pure-functional state, rebuild-every-frame rendering, and
a modern dark/light aesthetic out of the box.

Skald reads like iced or Elm at the API level, and its rebuild-every-frame
model puts it in the immediate-mode performance tier rather than the
retained-tree one. See [`docs/benchmarks.md`](docs/benchmarks.md) for
actual numbers.

> **Pure-Odin text backend (runa) is now the default.** Skald ships
> [`runa`](skald/third_party/runa/) as the default text engine, with
> `vendor:fontstash` retained as a fallback (build with
> `-define:SKALD_RUNA=false` to opt out). Runa brings real OpenType
> shaping (ligatures, GPOS kerning, contextual alternates), COLRv0 +
> COLRv1 colour emoji (with linear / radial / sweep gradients), and
> subpixel-x positioning — and it's faster than fontstash on every
> benched workload (gallery 2.2× faster).

## Highlights

- **Elm architecture** — `init` / `update` / `view` with a pure `Msg` union.
  No imperative widget handles, no signal wiring; your app's `State`
  struct is the source of truth for app-level data.
- **Immediate-mode performance** — the view tree is rebuilt every frame
  from the app's state, so there's no retained widget graph to diff or
  keep in sync. Frame times under 1 ms on most apps on a modern desktop
  GPU (Linux); capped by display refresh on macOS.
- **GPU rendering** — pure-Odin Vulkan 1.3 backend (`vendor:vulkan`), one
  pipeline for rects + text + images.
- **Two text backends** — the pure-Odin `runa` engine ships vendored
  at `skald/third_party/runa/` and is the default since 1.0: full
  OpenType shaping (ligatures, GPOS kerning), COLRv0 + COLRv1 colour
  emoji (with linear / radial / sweep gradients), and subpixel-x
  positioning. Runa is faster than fontstash on every benched
  workload (gallery 2.2× faster). `vendor:fontstash` is retained as a
  smaller, no-shaping fallback — opt back in with
  `-define:SKALD_RUNA=false` if you need it.
- **Async** — the `Command(Msg)` effect system runs file I/O, native
  dialogs, and delays through `core:nbio` on the main thread; completions
  round-trip back as regular `Msg` values. For sync libraries that aren't
  nbio-shaped (postgres, sqlite, big-file parsers), `cmd_thread` runs the
  blocking call on a worker thread and delivers the return value as a Msg.
  The UI never freezes; `view` and `update` always run single-threaded.
- **Real widget set** — buttons, checkboxes, sliders, selects, text inputs
  (single + multi-line, with undo/clipboard/selection), tables, virtual
  lists, tabs, menus, dialogs, image, split panes, toasts, drag-and-drop,
  context menus, command palette, tree, date / time / color pickers.
- **Themable** — dark + light themes ship in-tree (GitHub Primer / Radix
  tuned); custom themes are a plain struct. Ships with i18n `Labels`,
  font-fallback chaining (`font_add_fallback`), and a
  `system_theme()` probe plus an `on_system_theme_change` callback so
  apps can follow the OS light/dark setting if they want.
- **Window state hooks** — `initial_window_state` to seed the window
  on launch, `on_window_state_change` to hear about user resize /
  move / maximize. Your app decides where/how to persist the state
  (JSON on disk, embedded in a `settings.db`, wherever) — Skald just
  reports the current geometry as a plain struct. Cookbook has the
  pattern.
- **Multi-window** — `cmd_open_window` / `cmd_close_window` spawn
  and tear down extra OS windows (popovers, notification bubbles,
  panels, HUDs). Each gets its own Vulkan swapchain, input, and
  widget store; the app's `view` is called per window with
  `ctx.window` set so one proc can render all of them. Device,
  pipeline, fonts, and images stay shared — only the swapchain and
  per-frame plumbing are per-window.
- **Keyboard-first** — Tab ring, shift-Tab, focus trap inside modals,
  focus restoration on dialog/palette close, `widget_tab_index` for
  explicit ordering, global `shortcut()` registration.
- **Cross-platform** — Linux (primary), Windows, macOS.

## One C dependency

Skald has one external C dependency: **SDL3**, for cross-platform
windowing, input, clipboard, file dialogs, and HiDPI / multi-monitor
handling. We use it via Odin's `vendor:sdl3` bindings — those are
Odin procs that map to SDL3's C ABI, but the runtime that actually
does the work is the C library (`libSDL3.so` / `SDL3.dll` /
`libSDL3.dylib`), so a Skald binary links against and loads compiled
C code at startup. `vendor:sdl3` is **bindings, not a re-implementation**.

Everything else — Vulkan renderer, OpenType shaping (via the vendored
pure-Odin `runa` engine), layout, widgets, atlas, theming, async — is
pure Odin top-to-bottom.

Why SDL3 specifically: cross-platform windowing and input is a vast
edge-case surface (Wayland ↔ X11 transitions, IME, pen tablets,
fractional scaling, multi-monitor refresh, macOS Spaces, Windows raw
input, fullscreen modes, drag-and-drop) and SDL3 is the most
battle-tested option that handles all of it. Rolling our own per-OS
platform layer (X11+Wayland / Win32 / Cocoa) would be months of work
and a long tail of edge cases to re-discover. A pure-Odin platform
layer is on the table post-1.0 if uptake justifies the maintenance
cost; for v1 the trade-off doesn't pay back.

## Quick start

Prerequisites vary by platform. See [`PLATFORMS.md`](PLATFORMS.md) for
the exact commands; the short version:

- **Linux** — install SDL3 (`sudo apt install libsdl3-0` or equivalent)
  and a Vulkan loader (`libvulkan1` on most distros). On Ubuntu 24.04
  LTS, SDL3 isn't yet packaged — `PLATFORMS.md` has the build-from-
  source recipe. First-time Odin install also needs the stb static
  libs built once: `make -C $ODIN_ROOT/vendor/stb/src`.
- **Windows** — Odin's `vendor:sdl3` bundles `SDL3.dll` and `build.bat`
  copies it next to the exe automatically. Vulkan loader ships with
  recent GPU drivers or the LunarG Vulkan SDK.
- **macOS** — `brew install sdl3` plus the
  [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#mac) (installs
  MoltenVK + loader). Source `~/VulkanSDK/*/setup-env.sh` in your
  shell, or run the SDK's system-install script.

```bash
git clone <your-fork> skald && cd skald
./build.sh 07_counter run  # build + run the counter example
```

On Windows:

```bat
build.bat 07_counter run
```

## Hello, Skald

```odin
package hello

import "core:fmt"
import "gui:skald"

State :: struct { count: int }

Msg :: enum { Inc, Dec }

init :: proc() -> State { return {} }

update :: proc(s: State, m: Msg) -> (State, skald.Command(Msg)) {
    switch m {
    case .Inc: return {count = s.count + 1}, {}
    case .Dec: return {count = s.count - 1}, {}
    }
    return s, {}
}

view :: proc(s: State, ctx: ^skald.Ctx(Msg)) -> skald.View {
    th := ctx.theme
    return skald.col(
        skald.text(fmt.tprintf("Count: %d", s.count),
            th.color.fg, th.font.size_display),
        skald.spacer(th.spacing.xl),
        skald.row(
            skald.button(ctx, "−", Msg.Dec, width = 64),
            skald.button(ctx, "+", Msg.Inc, width = 64,
                bg = th.color.primary, fg = th.color.on_primary),
            spacing = th.spacing.md,
        ),
        padding     = th.spacing.xl,
        main_align  = .Center,
        cross_align = .Center,
    )
}

main :: proc() {
    skald.run(skald.App(State, Msg){
        title  = "Hello",
        size   = {640, 400},
        theme  = skald.theme_dark(),
        init   = init,
        update = update,
        view   = view,
    })
}
```

## The name

A *skáld* (Old Norse) was a court poet — composer and reciter of
ornate stanzaic verse in intricate alliterative meters, built up
from individual stanzas into longer praise poems called *drápur*.
The metaphor fits: a Skald app is one view composed from small
widgets, each shaped with care. It's also a thematic nod to Odin
itself, which the framework is built on.

## License

Skald is licensed under the **zlib license** — see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).
Permissive: commercial use, modification, and redistribution are all
fine, with three light restrictions (don't misrepresent origin, mark
altered versions, keep the notice). Matches Odin's own license for
zero ecosystem friction.

Bundled-asset and third-party acknowledgements live in [`NOTICE`](NOTICE)
(separated from `LICENSE` so GitHub's auto-detector recognises the
zlib header cleanly).

The bundled Inter typeface — InterVariable plus the static-weight
Inter-Bold, Inter-Italic, and Inter-BoldItalic faces used by
`rich_text` for emphasis — ships under the SIL Open Font License
1.1; the full text travels alongside the fonts at
[`skald/assets/InterVariable-OFL.txt`](skald/assets/InterVariable-OFL.txt).

## Acknowledgments

Skald stands on good shoulders. Credit and thanks to:

- **[Odin](https://odin-lang.org)** (Ginger Bill) — the amazing language itself.
- **[SDL3](https://libsdl.org)** (Sam Lantinga and the SDL contributors) —
  windowing, input, clipboard, file dialogs, drag-and-drop.
- **[Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)** (The Inter Project Authors) —
  the bundled UI typeface. InterVariable is the default; the
  static-weight Bold / Italic / BoldItalic faces ship alongside it
  for `rich_text`'s emphasis spans.
- **runa** (Lee Fry + contributors) — pure-Odin text engine vendored
  at [`skald/third_party/runa/`](skald/third_party/runa/). zlib
  licence. Default text backend since 1.0; full OpenType shaping
  (GSUB / GPOS), Arabic / Indic / SEA shaping, RTL + bidi, and
  COLRv0 / COLRv1 colour emoji.
- **[fontstash](https://github.com/memononen/fontstash)**
  (Mikko Mononen) — glyph atlas management, shipped via
  `vendor:fontstash`. Legacy text backend retained as a fallback
  (`-define:SKALD_RUNA=false`).
- **[stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)** (Sean T. Barrett) —
  `stb_truetype` (used inside fontstash) and `stb_image` (PNG loading).
- **Vulkan** — specification by the Khronos Group; on macOS, Vulkan
  calls are translated to Metal by **[MoltenVK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/MoltenVK)**
  (originally by Brenwill Workshop Ltd., now maintained under
  Khronos).

If you build something nice with Skald, no obligation — but I'd love
to see it.
